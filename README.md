# Genimine
A multiplayer colonization game on the Blazor Platform.

Outline: Players join a lobby and start a colony. The object of the game is to create the most powerful colony on the server. 
Players use resources to build structures and vehicles, and resources are mined in the asteroid field.
Asteroids will disappear if they have been completely mined, making the player mine farther and farther awa from their colony, thus making the game more dangerous. 
After a period of time, asteroids will begin to float back into space so the entire server doesn't run out of resources.
Players can either attack other players who are mining to get their mined resources, or attack the other player's base and gain more territory. 
Territory is necessary to build more buildings to expand your colony. Differnt types of buildings can be made such as defense buildings, energy buildings, manufactuing plants, etc. 
Throughout the game, players can upgrade their buildings and ships to perform better, such as building and mining faster, have more health, have better attack stats, etc.
